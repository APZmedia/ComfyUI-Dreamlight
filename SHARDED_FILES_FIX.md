# Sharded Files Fix for FLUX Transformer

## Problem Identified
The transformer model comes in **sharded parts** rather than a single file:
- Expected: `transformer/diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors`
- Actual: `transformer/diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors.00001`, `.00002`, etc.

## Root Cause
FLUX.1-dev uses sharded files for large models to enable:
- Parallel downloads
- Resume capability
- Better memory management

## Fixes Applied

### ✅ **Enhanced Shard Detection**
- Updated `check_sharded_file()` to detect various shard patterns
- Handles patterns like `.00001`, `.0001`, `.001`, `.01`, `.1`
- Properly identifies when files are sharded vs. single files

### ✅ **Shard-Aware Recovery**
- Recovery logic now tries to download sharded files
- Attempts multiple shard patterns if the first one fails
- Provides clear feedback when sharded files are detected

### ✅ **Better Shard Logging**
- Shows total number of shard parts
- Displays total size across all shards
- Clear indication when sharded files are found

### ✅ **Restored Transformer Criticality**
- Made transformer critical again since we now handle shards properly
- The model is essential but can exist as sharded files

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Validation**: Will properly detect sharded transformer files
2. **Recovery**: Will attempt to download sharded files if missing
3. **Logging**: Will show "sharded, X parts, Y MB total" for transformer
4. **Functionality**: Node should work with sharded transformer files

## Technical Details

The fix handles these shard patterns:
- `diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors.00001`
- `diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors.0001`
- `diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors.001`
- `diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors.01`
- `diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors.1`

This covers the most common sharding patterns used by HuggingFace for large models.
