# ComfyUI-Dreamlight Installation Issue Analysis

## The Problem

The error `RuntimeError: FLUX directory validation failed` occurs because the FLUX.1-dev model download is **incomplete or failed**, but the code doesn't have proper retry logic for the large 23GB download.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Two Download Systems Conflict**
- **`setup_complete_flux_directory()`**: Downloads official FLUX.1-dev (23GB) to `/models/dreamlight/flux_complete/`
- **`validate_and_download_models()`**: Downloads DreamLight-specific models to `/models/dreamlight/FLUX/DreamLight-FLUX/transformer/`

### 2. **Large Download Without Retry Logic**
The original code downloads 23GB in a single attempt without:
- Retry logic for network failures
- Resume capability for interrupted downloads
- Progress reporting for long downloads

### 3. **Validation Too Strict**
The validation fails if ANY file is missing, even optional ones like `text_encoder_2/model.safetensors`.

## What Was Fixed

### ✅ **Improved Download Robustness**
- Added 3-attempt retry logic with 10-second delays
- Enabled `resume_download=True` for interrupted downloads
- Better error handling and progress reporting

### ✅ **Flexible Validation**
- Made `text_encoder_2` optional (non-critical)
- Added automatic recovery attempts for missing critical files
- Better error messages with step-by-step instructions

### ✅ **Consistent Directory Usage**
- Fixed inconsistent path usage between validation and processing
- Ensured all code uses the same `flux_complete` directory

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **First Run**: 
   - Downloads FLUX.1-dev (23GB) with retry logic
   - Shows progress messages during long download
   - Validates only critical components

2. **Subsequent Runs**:
   - Skips download if files already exist
   - Validates quickly and proceeds

3. **If Download Fails**:
   - Clear error messages with fix instructions
   - Automatic retry attempts
   - Recovery downloads for missing files

## User Action Required

**Restart ComfyUI** to load the updated code. The node will now:
- Retry failed downloads automatically
- Resume interrupted downloads
- Provide better feedback during the 23GB download process
- Work even if some optional components are missing

## Technical Details

The fix addresses these specific issues:
- **Network timeouts** during 23GB download → Added retry logic
- **Incomplete downloads** → Added resume capability  
- **Missing optional files** → Made validation more flexible
- **Poor error messages** → Added detailed troubleshooting steps
