# Simplified Download Approach

## Problem with Previous Approach
The previous code was trying to be too clever by:
- Downloading individual files
- Handling complex sharding patterns
- Trying alternative file names
- Complex recovery logic

## New Simplified Approach

### ✅ **Download Entire Repository**
- Uses `snapshot_download()` to get the complete FLUX.1-dev repository
- No more `ignore_patterns` that might skip important files
- Gets all files including sharded transformer files automatically

### ✅ **CLI Fallback**
- If Python download fails, tries HuggingFace CLI as backup
- Provides manual CLI command for users to run if needed
- More reliable for large downloads

### ✅ **Removed Complex Recovery**
- No more individual file downloads
- No more shard pattern matching
- No more alternative file name attempts
- Simple: download everything, validate everything

## Benefits

1. **Simpler Code**: Much less complex logic
2. **More Reliable**: Downloads everything at once
3. **Handles Sharding**: Automatically gets all shard files
4. **Better Error Messages**: Clear instructions for manual download
5. **CLI Fallback**: Alternative download method if Python fails

## Expected Behavior

1. **First Attempt**: Downloads entire FLUX.1-dev repository using Python
2. **CLI Fallback**: If Python fails, tries HuggingFace CLI
3. **Manual Option**: Provides CLI command for manual download
4. **Validation**: Checks that all required files are present

## Manual Download Command
If automatic download fails, users can run:
```bash
huggingface-cli download black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev --local-dir /path/to/flux_complete
```

This approach is much more robust and handles all the complexity of sharded files automatically.
